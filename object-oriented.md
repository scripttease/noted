# Object Oriented - Ruby, Python etc.

### Classes
Classes are simply a convenient way to organize functions (also called methods) [Hartle ROR] (https://www.railstutorial.org/book/static_pages)
In scaffolding frameworks like Rails and Django, class inheritance is used to give a set of repeatable defineable functions to classes the developer makes, turning them into 'controllers' or 'models' etc. 

### Functions
Functions are devices for grouping statements so that they can be easily run more than once in a program...

Functions enable dividing larger tasks into smaller chunks, an approach that
is called procedural decomposition..

in Python, Functions are written using the def statement.
You can send the result object back to the caller using the return statement.
